pxe-pdhcp
===========

A implementation of Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) server.

pxe-pdhcp works with DHCP server running on another host. The DHCP server
doesn't need to be configured for any PXE specific options. This means that
you can set up network boot environment without re-configuring existent DHCP
server.

    usage: pxe-pdhcp  [-d] [-i interface]
                      [-l listen address] [-t tftp address] <nbp name>

pxe-pdhcp listens and replies on ports (4011/udp and 68/udp) so the root
privilege is needed to run.

With -d option, pxe-pdhcp runs on foreground. This option is useful for debugging.

Specify nework interface name ('eth0' for example, on Linux) to -i option.

If the network interface has more than one IP address, use the -l, -t options.
The -i or (-l and -t) option is required.

Finally specify the path of Network Bootstrap Program on the TFTP server to
<nbp name> option. It will be 'pxelinux.0' if you are using PXELINUX.
